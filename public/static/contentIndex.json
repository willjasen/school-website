The topic in question is sexual abuse of many children.  In Capturing the Friedmans, many opinions come forth about whether or not Arnold committed the crimes.  Testimonies from many different people can make it very difficult for one to make a decision about what actually happened.  Despite what many people in the documentary testify, Arnold is not guilty of sexually abusing children in his basement.\nThe first and foremost evidence that Arnold is not guilty is simply the circumstance under which the kids were thought to have been sexually abused.  If many children were being abused, then the chance that not one child would say anything about what was being done to them at the time would be highly unlikely.  Parents would even randomly show up at the Friedman’s house, but no one suspected abuse of the children in the classroom.  There is no possible way Arnold could abuse the children, yet everything look completely fine when parents would come to pick up their child.\nIf abuse was happening at the Friedman’s house, then there was no evidence of it.  If the children had been abused, then at least one child at the time would have spoken up about what was happening, even if they did not know what was wrong or right.  The children who did not actually speak up would have changed their body language enough that an adult should have picked up on the change.  The children were also being reenrolled in classes, however, none objected to going back.  The children would have let an adult know about the reoccurring abuse happening. Even if no child would have admitted the abuse, the crimes that people claim Arnold committed would have left traces.  No blood or semen was ever found by parents of the students.  Bruises were never reported on any of the students, and with such physical abuse that was described later in the case, bruises would have shown up.\nThe police investigation into the accused crime was done with no rationality.  The hysteria that the event created fueled the corrupt police investigation.  The children were not properly interviewed, which led to incorrect testimonies from the children.  Instead asking the children what had happened at the Friedman’s house, they demanded the children to tell them what happened.  The children could have made up a story just so that they would not be pressured anymore.  Even one alleged victim of the crime admits making up a story so that his parents and the police would leave him alone about the issue.\nEven some of the students are at fault.  The students who say that Arnold did commit the crime often mix up their own stories.  However, these same students never said that anything was wrong while taking the classes.  Some students even did hypnosis, which has a tendency to implant false memories in children.  Now, those same children claim to remember memories that were blocked out by their minds about the times they were abused at the Friedman’s house.\nArnold did have a problem, though.  He did own the child pornography, indicating that he did have something to hide.  However, simply own child pornography is not enough to be convicted of sexual abuse of a child.  Perhaps even, he had sexual encounters with some boys at the vacation home.  Arnold realized he had this problem, and he was afraid that he may act upon these urges one day.  This let Arnold to plead guilty during his trial.  Arnold knew that if he went to prison, then he would not have to worry about controlling these urges because the new environment he would be in would not allow for it.\nIt may be possible that Arnold had abused boys at the vacation house.  Arnold had admitted to Elaine that there were at least two boys, in which he may be referring to boys at the vacation home.  However, that would be a totally different case, and does not affect the outcome of the case at his house.  This would confirm the problem that Arnold has, although he feels powerless to do anything about.  If this is a possibility, no one has come out yet to reveal that Arnold had abused them.\nAlthough it is hard to decipher what to believe when watching the movie, it becomes very apparent what actually took place.  Arnold could not have abused the children without being caught sooner.  Most evidence brought again Arnold was purely circumstantial, only compounded by the fact that he owned child pornography and hysteria of the middle class community.  This case only goes to show how easy hysteria can blow everything out of proportion and can cause such damage to a relatively small case like child pornography.\n\n"},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Essay-2/Essay-2---The-Green-Mile":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Essay-2/Essay-2---The-Green-Mile","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Essay 2/Essay 2 - The Green Mile.md","title":"Essay 2 - The Green Mile","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Green Mile (1999)\n\nBrandon Buchanan\nEnglish 1020 — Section 32\nCathy Whaley\nMarch 22, 2006\nA Mile Of Travesty\nThe Green Mile, directed by Frank Darabont, is a very compelling film, and can be seen as a supporter or opposer to the death penalty.  The array of diverse characters adds different perspectives to views on the death penalty.  However, when one looks at the details from scenes in the movie, one will see that the director shows that the death penalty is wrong.\nThe character portrayal of Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) shows that people on death row are still people, no matter how bad the crime committed was.  Even though Delacroix’s crime is not mentioned, it must have been horrible enough that he got a death sentence, however, Delacroix is shown as a caring person, especially for his mouse, Mr. Jingles.\nThis attitude is not always apparent with inmates on death row.  “Wild Bill” (Sam Rockwell) shows through his character that not all inmates on death row are as caring about others or themselves. When “Wild Bill” first comes into the prison, he makes a grand entrance by screaming as loud as he can, all while trying to suffocate one of the guards.  Even though some of the inmates may act nice, one must still be weary that these are people that are harmful to society.\nMost supporters of the death penalty want to see those who have committed horrible crimes pay for what they did, but many do not want to see those people suffer horribly at the same time.  This is apparent in the scene when Percy (Doug Hutchison) does not put the sponge on the head of Delacroix.  When the switch is flipped and the execution begins, Delacroix does not die as soon as the officers expect.  Delacroix twitches and screams in agony as electricity passes through him.  The execution’s audience begins to worry, and when they realize something has gone terribly wrong, they become disgusted and flee the room in terror.  This is in comparison to lethal injection today.  Lethal injection gives the appearance that the inmate being put to death is not suffering, but in many cases, this is not the case.  Inmates may be paralyzed and may not be able to move, but will feel the pain of suffocation as the drugs stop the lungs and heart.  Many people want to know the person on death row was put to death, however, many do not want to see the person suffer.\nAnother problem with the death penalty that the director addresses is innocent people on death row.  John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), as we find out later in the movie, is actually innocent.  This means that innocent people could very well be put to death, even though they did nothing.  If even one innocent person is put to death, then there should be an uproar, quite unlike what happened in regards to the movie.  Once Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) saw the vision that John Coffey gave him, he simply did not cause enough of an uproar, even though Coffey wanted to be put to death.\nWhen John Coffey chooses to be put to death, this illustrates that many people on death row would rather die then be locked up for the rest of their lives.  Coffey stated that he was too tired and he did not want to be around any of the hatred in the world.  Even though Coffey is innocent, it would not be punishment to put an inmate to death that was guilty.  The better punishment is to make the inmate serve life in prison, where they have their entire lives to reflect on the bad decisions they chose.\nThe family that thought John Coffey killed their two daughters did not receive any sort of true consolation because John Coffey did not kill them.  It was in fact “Wild Bill” that killed the two little girls.  The father tells the guards to “fry him twice.”  This shows how animalistic the urge for another human being to die is, especially when the person you wish killed has actually done nothing wrong.\nOne of the weaknesses about the Green Mile is that it uses the element of fantasy.  In the movie, John Coffey  has magical powers and is presented as a miracle worker.  This takes away from the seriousness of the death penalty issue.  Of course, magical powers are not actually set in reality, which can make it harder to relate some of the magical acts to the issue.\nAt the same time, this magical power that John holds symbolizes life.  John brings Mr. Jingles back to life after Percy crushes the mouse with his foot.  He even cures Paul’s infection.  The irony of the movie is that Paul Edgecomb did not try to save John Coffey, and when Paul sees the visions of John, he receives some of John’s mysterious powers.  This causes Paul to live into old age, in which he must watch his friends and family pass away before he does.  The ironic situation is that while working on the Green Mile, Paul could have attempted to save John and let him live, but now, he must watch his loved ones die, and he can do nothing about it.\nJohn Coffey is shown as a supernatural figure, almost as if he is God.  John Coffey infects Percy with the disease he takes from Hal Moores’ (James Cromwell) wife.  Percy becomes sick and disillusioned, and when “Wild Bill” begins to get rowdy, Percy shoots him multiple times in the chest.  Percy does not remember what he does and is sent to a mental hospital.  John Coffey says that they were both bad people and he gave them both what they deserved.  This scene portrays John Coffey as the “judge, jury, and executioner,” very similar to a portrayal of God.\nIn conclusion, Frank Darabont had intent to make the movie be against the death penalty.  The scenes can be picked apart to show that the death penalty is not the correct punishment for any prisoner, no matter how horrible the crime was.  There are flaws within the justice system and many innocent people may be put on death row, and possibly put to death.  If these people are just given a life sentence, then there is always a possibility for freedom once more, but if the person is put to death, then it is over.  The Green Mile is not just a casual movie, but it is a movie that demands contemplation by the audience on such a serious issue.\n\n"},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Other-Assignments/Death-Penalty-Stats":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Other-Assignments/Death-Penalty-Stats","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Other Assignments/Death Penalty Stats.md","title":"Death Penalty Stats","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Other-Assignments/Top-10-Films-List":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Other-Assignments/Top-10-Films-List","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Other Assignments/Top 10 Films List.md","title":"Top 10 Films List","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nThe Matrix (1999)\nHellraiser (1987)\nSaw (2004)\nDonnie Darko (2001)\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\nHedwig and the Angry Inch (2001)\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)\nThe Truman Show (1998)\nHackers (1995)\nThe Butterfly Effect (2004)\n\n\n"},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Other-Assignments/War-In-Iraq":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Other-Assignments/War-In-Iraq","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Other Assignments/War In Iraq.md","title":"War In Iraq","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"January 18, 2007\n"},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Annotated-Bibliography":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Annotated-Bibliography","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Research Paper/Annotated Bibliography.md","title":"Annotated Bibliography","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Crowcroft, Jon. &quot;Net neutrality: The Technical Side of the Debate: The White Paper.&quot; ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 37.1 (January 2007) 49-56.

I eventually started to look through the LexisNexis database and I found more newspaper and magazine articles, but I was still having trouble finding articles that were not the same as each other. I decided to take some time out and think about more ways I could take my paper and I was able to think of more ways, then go back into the articles and find portions to support my ideas.\nWhile looking for articles on net neutrality, I came across the idea of scrapping the Internet. This was interesting to me, so I thought I would include it in my argument. Recreating the internet could solve the idea of net neutrality because the practicality of the idea could be engineered into the architecture. Even though I had already heard of Internet2, I found out that the Next Generation Internet is a separate internetwork that is trying to resolve the bandwidth and latency issues of the Internet.\nAnother problem I had was figuring out how to cite the articles. LexisNexis did not exactly say what kind of source it was, so I was forced to determine whether it was a magazine or newspaper by the information that was given at the top of the source. I also found a whitepaper and was not sure how to cite it.\n\n"},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Research-Paper---Net-Neutrality":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Research-Paper---Net-Neutrality","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Research Paper/Research Paper - Net Neutrality.md","title":"Research Paper - Net Neutrality","links":["🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Annotated-Bibliography","🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Bibliography-Summary","🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Research-Paper-Process","🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Sources"],"tags":[],"content":"Here’s is the research paper for our final project for the semester - I chose to write about net neutrality\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\nBibliography Summary\nResearch Paper Process\nSources\n\n\nBrandon Buchanan\nEnglish 1020-32\nCathy Whaley\n3 May 2007\nFree the Internet!\nThe Internet is in danger of being corrupted by government officials and the businesses they pull for.  Many political officials in Congress think that allowing a major internet carrier the right to give priority to certain traffic and website while slowing or even blocking other traffic is completely fine (Weiss 2).  Net neutrality is an important aspect of the Internet to maintain if open and fair access is to be available to every person that uses it.\nThe Internet is in danger of being corrupted by government officials and the businesses they pull for.

Many political officials in Congress think that allowing a major internet carrier the right to give priority to certain traffic and website while slowing or even blocking other traffic is completely fine (Weiss 2).  Net neutrality is an important aspect of the Internet to maintain if open and fair access is to be available to every person that uses it.\nThe Internet was built on the basis that all packets are created equal, meaning that a website request packet is no different that a file transfer packet at the core of the internet. The Internet was designed to handle packets on an equal basis rather than prioritizing certain kinds of traffic.  Its architecture makes end to end service use more bandwidth capacity the further one host is from the other (Crowcroft 51).  Quality of service can inspect a packet&#039;s information, determine what type of traffic is carried within, and process it accordingly.  Dipankar Raychaundhuri, a Rutgers University professor, states that the Internet “works well in many situations but was designed for completely different assumptions... it is sort of a miracle that it continues to work well today” (Jesdanun).\nThe first is the fear of a two-tier Internet. As providers build faster networks, there is reason to believe that they will seek additional compensation to place content on the “fast lane” and leave those unwilling to pay consigned to the slow lane...  Consider an Internet where U.S. Television and movie productions zip quickly to consumers computer because U.S. Studios have paid for the fast lane, while Canadian and user generated content creeps along in the slow lane...  The second concern is that ISPs will block or degrade access to content or applications they don&#039;t like, often for competitive reasons. (Geist 2)\n\nAn example is that an internet service provider that offered voice over IP service.  The internet service provider could throttle or block third party voice over IP traffic in an attempt to get customers using their network to switch to their voice over IP service rather than using the third party, in effect, creating a monopolization of voice over IP service within the service provider&#039;s network (Kabay 2).\nAnother aspect of net neutrality is to keep the communications carrier apart from what data is sent on the network.  This means that if a user on the network does something illegally, then the service provider should not be responsible for that user&#039;s actions.  Internet services providers who wish to use quality of service to prioritize certain traffic while throttling others may then be brought into legality of a user&#039;s actions on the network because the network is no longer content-neutral (Kabay 7).  Take for example the case Lumney v. Prodigy in which Lumney sued Prodigy on claims that another user had stolen his identity and used his email address to sent threatening e-mails. A judge ruled in favor of Prodigy, stating that “Prodigy&#039;s role in transmitting e-mail is akin to that of a telephone company, where one neither wants nor expects to superintend the content of its subscribers&#039; conversation.  In this respect, an ISP, like a telephone company, is merely a conduit” (Kabay 6).  In this regard, internet service providers should want net neutrality for the protection it offers from the government and the judicial branches.\nNet neutrality is not just as simple as keeping the Internet fair.  It requires that different services on the Internet or services of the internet service provider remain fair and balanced for all.  Fair connectivity between networks is crucial for net neutrality, but it is not the only aspect. Performance neutrality should include a standard for applications, while service neutrality should give the customer more choices to gain a better service (Crowcroft 54).  Each aspect helps to break down net neutrality and make it easier to maintain.\nLaws are already in place to ensure net neutrality stays. The Net Neutrality Act of 2006 keeps broadband providers in line by requiring fair treatment of traffic, content, and users on a network. An internet service provider also must not throttle bandwidth or disrupt users from receiving information from the Internet in a fair manner. The act allows home users to run any network device within their network with protection from the internet service provider.  It also allows competition for services; an internet service provider cannot block a competing company&#039;s device or traffic, even if the internet service provider offers the same service (Hand 2).  Traffic could also be throttled, taking for example, BitTorrent, a peer to peer file sharing protocol widely used for pirating movies and film, but is also legitimately used by artists and movie makers to distribute their work (Geist 2).\nThough maybe not apparent at first, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution supports the idea of net neutrality. The idea of free speech is one of the core traits of the Internet today.  Many people use the Internet as a debate forum for political and social issues affecting the world today.  Broadband providers can choose to throttle traffic or even block sites that may contain material the service provider does not like.  This is a clear obstruction of freedom of speech and cannot be tolerated.  Net neutrality protects freedom of speech by allowing equal access to information by any user.  If any other argument for net neutrality is not valid enough, the argument for freedom of speech infringement should settle the dispute.\nNet neutrality is not a widely known issue, which may be why there is not much support for it.  If the public knew about the issues at hand, then maybe more concern would be directed toward the problem.  The general public must unite against the corporations that oppose net neutrality and put pressure on our legislative branch of government to enact laws to protect net neutrality (Hand 3).  The Internet consists of a global community and all people within the community should take the stand in favor of net neutrality, less they be unfairly discriminated by simply because they may not have enough money to pay for the quality of service that a big business could buy. As it currently stands, the big telcos like Verizon and AT&amp;T currently adhere to net neutrality because of laws enacted, however, the expiration date of these laws ends by 2009 (Engebretson 2).\nOpponents of net neutrality are usually in political positions or stand monetary gain from getting rid of the idea.  Opponents of the idea argue that taking away service from some users or downgrading the quality of some applications will boost service greatly for other users or applications (Crowcroft 54).  However, they fail to realize that creating this unfairness is not what the Internet is about.  Frannie Wellings, the associated policy director for Free Press, said that, “We&#039;re concerned that the Internet will turn into the cable model, where gatekeepers  control access to content” (Engebretson 1).  She goes on by stating that the innovation of users on the Internet will dwindle because of the high price cost of enforcing an unfair quality of service, and notes that giants now, like Google, may not have survived had net neutrality not been in place.\nInstead of implementing quality of service on the Internet and disrupting net neutrality, it is better to just build another Internet. A program at Stanford university is currently researching the necessary steps it would take to bring a new Internet that will be equipped to handle data, voice, and video, while ensuring that no service is disrupted from the use of another.  In a paper released by the research team at Stanford, they described their views of the Internet as:\nWe believe that the current Internet has significant deficiencies that need to be solved before it can become a unified global communication infrastructure.  Further, we believe that the Internet&#039;s shortcomings will not be resolved by the conventional incremental and “backward-compatible” style of academic and industrial network research... In summary, we don&#039;t believe that we can or should continue to rely on a network that is often broken, frequently disconnected, unpredictable in its behavior, ramping with (and unprotected from) malicious users, and probably not economically sustainable. (McKeown 1-2)\n\nInternet2 makes this idea come true.  Take for example that astronomers wish to share data transmitted from a telescope with other astronomers around the world, all in real time (Graves 1). This can partially be accomplished on today&#039;s Internet, however, the scenario demands a quality of service that simply cannot be built into the Internet currently (Graves 2). With Internet2, not only the end to end bandwidth is increased, but quality of service techniques to insure specifications on throughput and latency so that such scenarios become a reality, while also using the IPv6 addressing scheme for its enhanced functionality over the current IPv4 implementation that is dominant on the Internet today.\nAnother new global network that is in its early stages is Next Generation Internet.  It is very similar to Internet2, but it is not exactly the same.  Four existing networks – DREN, NREN, ESnet, and the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) – combine to make up Next Generation Internet.  It is in the process of testing, as routers and switch are continuously upgraded to perfect the network, while the fiber optic cable is already in place (Fowler 27).  The project also hopes that the current Internet developers will pick up on the technology being used and apply it to increase bandwidth on the Internet (Fowler 28).\nNot only does the core of these networks need to be fast, but in order for the end user to receive the upgraded service, the service needs to be included at the “last mile” of the network. The last mile refers to the portion of the network closest to the end user, for example, at a home or a small business.  The network technologies must be able to handle the service, as well as the user&#039;s computer and network.  While computers now may be able to handle the traffic now, it is possible that these machines will become obsolete within years (Fowler 28).\nIn conclusion, the Internet needs to remain fair and balanced to keep net neutrality. The Internet has united communications throughout the world with the instant ability to receive news, send electronic messages, or to collaborate with people at a distance not possible beforehand. Although another Internet can be built, perhaps with quality of service engrained into its design, the original should stay fair as it is currently, as it helps to advance communications across the world, making the world just a bit smaller.  If net neutrality does not prevail on the current Internet, then the world starts to slowly expand again.\n\n"},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Research-Paper-Process":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Research-Paper-Process","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Research Paper/Research Paper Process.md","title":"Research Paper Process","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Sources":{"slug":"🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/Research-Paper/Sources","filePath":"🏫 College/Spring 2007/English 1020/Research Paper/Sources.md","title":"Sources","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"We had to print out and preserve the sources that we used for the research paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"🏫-College/🏫-College":{"slug":"🏫-College/🏫-College","filePath":"🏫 College/🏫 College.md","title":"🏫 College","links":["🏫-College/Fall-2006/Astronomy-1/Astronomy-1","🏫-College/Fall-2006/School-Items-List","🏫-College/Spring-2007/English-1020/--English-1020--"],"tags":["school-in-progress","school"],"content":"Here’s the college stuff -
